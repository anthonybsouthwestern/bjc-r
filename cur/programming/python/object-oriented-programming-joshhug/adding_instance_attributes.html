            Now, let's discuss the second method for adding instance attributes, which involves adding them after your object has already been created. So far, we've created a hunger_games book object with the instance attributes genre, title, author, and publication_year. Say that we also want it to be known that the owner of this particular book is Alonzo.
            But how do we do that if we've already made the book? Observe!
            <code><pre>
                >>> hunger_games.owner = 'Alonzo'
            </pre></code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Done! Now this specific book object has an instance attribute <em>owner</em>.
        <pre><code>
>>> hunger_games.owner
>>>'Alonzo'
        </code></pre>
            We can apply this technique to any object we want to add an instance attribute to.
            Here are some of the most common situations it comes into play:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We can use dot notation to change the value of instance attributes if the attribute already exists.</li>
            <li>Similarly, if we change the name on the left of the dot to be the name of a class, we can assign and change class attributes.</li>
            <li>Finally, if we use dot notation using the name of an instance on the left, and there is no instance attribute which corresponds to the name we are looking for, but there is a class attribute, it will assign a new instance attribute to that instance <strong>without changing the value for the overall class.</strong> <br> Here is an example of this:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <pre><code>
class Test:
    value = 1
    def __init__(self, number):
        self.number = number

>>> example = Test(7)
>>> example.number
7
>>> example.value
1
>>> Test.value
1
>>> example.value = 7
>>> example.value
7
>>> Test.value
1
            </pre></code>
        </p>
