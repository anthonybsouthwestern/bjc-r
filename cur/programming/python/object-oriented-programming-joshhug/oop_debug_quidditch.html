            <h3>Working with the QuidditchPlayer Class</h3>
            <p>
                It's time for the opening quidditch match of the season! We represent the various positions for players with the QuidditchPlayer class and its subclasses in oop_debugging.py. Every player begins with a base_energy level, but every position requires a different proportion of energy. 
                Fill in the energy method for the Beater, Chaser, Seeker, and Keeper classes, according to their docstrings. In addition, fill in the __init__ method for the Chaser class.
            </p>
            <p> Once you're done, run the following command in your terminal to play the game: </p>
            <pre><code>$ python3 -i quidditch_game.py
            </code></pre>
            <p>Nice job! You have finished the lab! Hopefully this helps you in understanding OOP, and debugging in your final project.</p>
