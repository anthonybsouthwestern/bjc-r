        <p>
            While you have already used multiple sprites, such as when <a href="https://anthonybsouthwestern.github.io/bjc-r/cur/programming/intro/drawing/kaleidoscope-small.html"
	    target="blank">making a Kaleidoscope</a>, now you will have multiple sprites with customized costumes that move independently of each other. 
        </p>
       
        <ul>

            <li>
                You will need to add sprites to your project. You can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-new-sprite.png" alt="Snap new sprite button">
                between the stage and the sprite corral, at the center right of the window. Alternatively, you can right-click on a sprite to duplicate it, 
                and then make changes to the one you created. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Each sprite will have separate costumes and scripting areas: click on the image in the sprite corral to
                focus on it.  To add costumes, you just need to drag an image from a page in your browser
                over to the scripting area of your snap window.  Here are costumes you should use, with labels to their 
		    right and the x and y coordinates where they should be placed originally. You can right-click on 
		    an image to download it to your machine:
                <div class="center">
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/sun.png" alt="Sun costume" <span>Sun (1, 1) </span> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/Mercury.png" alt="Mercury costume"> <span>Mercury (30, 3)</span> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/Venus.png" alt="Venus costume"> <span>Venus (46, 0) </span> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/Earth.png" alt="Earth costume"> <span>Earth (60, 2) </span> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/Mars.png" alt="Mars costume"> <span>Mars (75, 1) </span> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/Jupiter.png" alt="Jupiter costume"> <span>Jupiter (100, 7)</span> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/Saturn.png" alt="Saturn costume"> <span>Saturn (132, -1) </span> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/Uranus.png" alt="Uranus costume"> <span>Uranus (160, -2) </span> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/Neptune.png" alt="Neptune costume"> <span>Neptune (197, -1) </span> 
                </div>

            </li>
		<li>
			Place the sun and planets at the following locations. One way to do so is by using the 
			<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="go to x y"/> block. 
			It may also be helpful to use the 
			<a href=" https://anthonybsouthwestern.github.io/bjc-r/cur/programming/intro/sprites/sprites-reporters.html"
	    target="blank">sensor blocks</a> seen in a previous lab to determine if they are placed appropriately. 
			You may use any reasonable approach that has the sun and all planets placed appropriately when the lab is opened.
			
		</li>
            <li>
                Each sprite will have different scripts.  To switch between the scripts and costumes for a sprite, use the
                tabs at the top of the scripting area.
            </li>
          <li>
            Go to the Backgrounds tab when you have the Stage selected (located similarly to where you find Costumes when you have a sprite selected) and create an all-black background. If you later wish to add stars, you may.
          </li>
        </ul>
