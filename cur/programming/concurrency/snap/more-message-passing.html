            We are all quite familiar with the green flag icon, but what is it actually doing when we use it to start a program?  The green flag can in fact be seen
            as a special kind of broadcast.  When we click the green flag icon at the top right of the screen this sends out a "message" that tells any script
            with a green flag hat block to start executing.  You can think of the green flag button as a radio station broadcasting on a particular channel.
            Then only scripts who are tuned to that channel (i.e. have a green flag hat block) will receive the message. 
            This same idea of message passing can be seen in the scripts below:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <img class="indent" alt="when space pressed" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/when-space-pressed-play-note.png">
            </li>
            <li>
                <img class="indent" alt="when up arrow pressed" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/when-up-arrow-pressed.png">
            </li>
            <li>
                <img class="indent" alt="when I receive message" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/when-receive-message.png">
            </li>
            <li>
                <img class="indent" alt="when green flag clicked" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/when-green-flag-play-note.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Note:</em> Whether we start a script by clicking the green flag button, using broadcast, or through keyboard input we are always using
            message passing even though it may not always be obvious.
        </p>
        
        <p> The play note ones should work on lab machines. Some of the other sound ones may not be as feasible in the classroom. For example,
            recording a sound such as the 'snap' sound seen in later pages (the sound of a literal snap of the fingers) may require
            access to the computer's microphone. If you want to try this, you can use the sounds tab (to the right of costumes).
