            You will now have each planet move to orbit the sun, drawing a line showing its path. 
          The procedure will be the same for each planet, but the amount and direction that each move will vary.
        </p>

      <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            Recall the Snap<em>!</em> program you saw in <a href="https://anthonybsouthwestern.github.io/bjc-r/cur/programming/intro/snap/welcome-to-snap2.html">Welcome to Snap<em!</em></a>.:

            You will be placing a block with similar components for each planet. 
        </p>
       
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each planet will need the hat block for when the green flag is clicked, which will then control the planet's movement and the drawing of its orbit.
          </li>

          <li>
            Before any drawing or movement happens, clear any existing path that is drawn.
          </li>

          <li>
            Set the pen color for the orbit for each planet to be a color that is as similar as possible to the most predominant color on the planet image. 
            You need not be overly precise, but the path for Earth shouldn't be red!
          </li>

          <li>
            Put the pen down.
          </li>

          <li>
            Use the forever block which you saw in <a href="https://anthonybsouthwestern.github.io/bjc-r/cur/programming/random/randomly-moving-character.html">Randomly moving a character</a> 
            to continuously move the sprite and draw its orbit. See below for the number of steps to move and the degrees to turn (clockwise) for each planet. 
              <em>These are not guaranteed to accurately represent planetary movement, but should have the planets orbiting the sun. </em>
            <br>
            Mercury: move 5 steps, turn 10 degrees
            <br>
            Venus: move 7 steps, turn 9 degrees
              <br>
              Earth: move 10 steps, turn 10 degrees
              <br>
              Mars: move 10 steps, turn 8 degrees
              <br> 
              Jupiter: move 10 steps, turn 6 degrees
              <br>
              Saturn: move 10 steps, turn 4.5 degrees
              <br>
              Uranus: move 10 steps, turn 3.7 degrees
              <br>
              Neptune: move 10 steps, turn 3 degrees
          </li>

            <li>
                Optional challenge: Without changing the components above, add in additional space features, such as moons of planets or other celestial bodies. 
            </li>
        </ul>
