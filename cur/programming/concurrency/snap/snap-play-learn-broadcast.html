            While you may have already used multiple sprites, now we will see how you can have them interact with each other via message passing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>broadcast</code> block allows us to control which block is run next through message passing.
            Try to make these scripts in Snap<em>!</em>.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img title="Script of Alonzo for the Play" alt="Script of Alonzo for the Play" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/Alonzo-scripts.png" >
            <img  src="/bjc-r/img/prog/Duck-scripts.png" alt="Script of the Duck for the Play" title="Script of the Duck for the Play" >
        </div>
        <ul>

            <li>
                You'll need to add a sprite to your project: use <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-new-sprite.png" alt="Snap new sprite button">
                between the stage and the sprite corral, at the center right of the window.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each sprite will have separate costumes and scripting areas: click on the image in the sprite corral to
                focus on it.  To add costumes, you just need to drag an image from a page in your browser
                over to the scripting area of your snap window.  Here are costumes you can use:
                <div class="center">
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/alonzo.gif" alt="Alonzo sprite costume">
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/duck1.png" alt="Duck sprite costume">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Each sprite will have different scripts.  To switch between the scripts and costumes for a sprite, use the
                tabs at the top of the scripting area.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you are done, press <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-green-flag.png" alt="Snap green flag button"> to start the short play.
            </li>
        </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>A note about style:</em> You will notice that we chose to name the messages that were broadcast so that it would help us keep track
                of what we were doing and what messages we were sending. We recommend that you do this in your projects!
