          Now you get to combine messaging passing and sounds! Create your own play, using two or more sprites with costumes
          of your choice (but not the default) sprite image. Have the sprites have different scripts, passing messages back 
          and forth, to play notes (or use other features in the sound tab) to make something that appeals to you. 
          Explain your choices in comments.
