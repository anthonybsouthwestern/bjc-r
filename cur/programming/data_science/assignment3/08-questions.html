        <p>
            Once we query a Table using <code>GROUP</code> or <code>PIVOT</code>, we can answer more specific questions about the data by accessing the Table we get.
            In the case of a <code>GROUP</code> call, the returned value is a Table, so we can access it using DASIS blocks we have seen before. In the case of a
            <code>PIVOT</code> call, the result is not a Table, so we must access it like a Snap<em>!</em> list with the
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/item-i-block.png" alt="Item i of list block" style="width:10%"/> block.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using this strategy, use the <code>GROUP</code> and <code>PIVOT</code> blocks on the cleaned version of your movies Table to answer the following questions.
            You can make this helper block and use it as necessary.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Who has directed the most movies in this dataset? </li>
            <li> On average, which decade in the dataset had the longest movies? (Hint: use <code>GROUP</code>'s optional grouping function argument) </li>
            <li> How many comedy movies were released in the 1960s? (Hint: add a new column to the Table that indicates the decade in which a given movie was released) </li>
            <li> How many science fiction movies were released in the 1980s? </li>
        </ol>
