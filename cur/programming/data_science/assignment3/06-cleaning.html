            The <code>GROUP</code> block and the <code>PIVOT</code> block allow us the ability to categorize rows of a dataset into groups.
            But what happens when there is a row is missing data that would have been used to categorize it?
        </p>

        <p>
            This is where we can talk about <b>cleaning</b> data. Not all collected data is <b>clean</b>, or able to be readily queried and used in
            data analysis or visualizations. Cleaning data is an important skill for a data scientist, and we can talk about some ways to clean
            data using the blocks you have learned about thus far.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unclean data can take many forms:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> missing values </li>
            <li> outlier/nonsensical values (for example, a negative popularity score, when popularity is supposed to be on a 0 to 100 scale) </li>
            <li> incorrect data types (in other programming languages, this could mean having a column of text values when the column needs to be treated as numbers) </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Solving these issues can a complicated and nuanced task, that many times involves a background in probability and/or statistics. For our purposes,
            you do not need to have these skills yet, but there are a few ideas we want to outline about cleaning data.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li> Simply removing missing values from a dataset is not always the solution; the reason the data was missing from those rows may be a reason to leave them in the dataset.
                Removing them may introdice a <b>bias</b> to your data </li>
            <li> Simply removing outliers presents the same issue, there may be a reason the data was collected with these default outlier/nonsensical values </li>
            <li> Changing data types is typically safe, but you should always maintain a copy of the original data just in case you need to revert back (Snap<em>!</em>
                takes care of most types for you, so this is more important in other languages like Python) </li>
            <li> Any of these issues could just stem from human error, so it is important to understand how your data was collected before you begin cleaning it </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While all of the datasets in these assignments was cleaned before you downloaded them, you can use some of the DASIS blocks we have learned about
            so far to clean data you use yourself. The <code>WHERE</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>RELABEL</code> blocks (among others) can be used to modify
            a Table you import that contains unclean data. We will not go into tremendous detail in these assignments, but it is important to know that cleaning
            data is an integral part of using data science tools.
