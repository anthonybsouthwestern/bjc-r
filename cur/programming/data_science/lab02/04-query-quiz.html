					Assuming we used the same query on the Table with taxis that were dropped off in <b>Manhattan</b>,
                    we would now know the average distance for the Queens taxis and the Manhattan taxis. After finding
                    these numbers using queries, which of the following could <b>not</b> be a reason for the difference in these numbers?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="choice" identifier="c1">
				<div class="text">
					In this dataset, since all taxis originated in Manhattan, they had to travel further to get to Queens
                    for dropoff.
				</div>
				<div class="feedback">
					Not quite. Nearly every dataset does not represent every possible data point in the world. Sometimes, datasets only
                    represent a small amount of data, and therefore exhibit a <b>bias</b> that causes certain patterns to emerge.
                    In this case, it can be seen that this data does not represent all 5 boroughs of New York equally.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="choice" identifier="c2">
				<div class="text">
					People who live in Queens cause their taxi drivers to get lost, and therefore drive further.
				</div>
				<div class="feedback">
					Correct! Correlation <b>does not equal</b> causation, meaning that if a pattern emerges from data, then
                    there does not have to be an obvious cause for that pattern. Just because data shows a pattern,
                    does not mean any explanation for that pattern is automatically true. Any conclusion made like this
                    must be supported by other data-driven conclusions, which this one is assuredly not.

			<div class="choice" identifier="c3">
				<div class="text">
					The size of this dataset does not fully represent New York taxis, so this result could be an anomaly.
				</div>
				<div class="feedback">
					Not quite. For example, if you flip heads 3 times in a row on a fair coin, the small sample size could lead
                    to an incorrect conclusion. A fair coin does not only land on heads, 
                    but with the small sample size of 3 that may appear to be the case even with a Table query.

			<div class="choice" identifier="c4">
				<div class="text">
					There may be some other field-related knowledge that would help us explain the difference.
				</div>
				<div class="feedback">
					Not quite. In data science, field-specific knowledge can be very helpful when interpreting data. In this case,
                    knowing more about New York transportation could help us draw a concrete conclusion, but our dataset
                    does not have enough information to accurately make a conclusion ourselves.
