        <p>
            The <code>DELETE column</code> and <code>DELETE row</code> blocks are used to remove data from a Table.
            They are all command blocks, so their changes to the Table are <b>permanent</b>. We can delete a column
            with either its index or its label, but we can only delete rows by their index because they do not have labels.
            Additionally, we can delete several columns at once using a list of column names.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>DELETE</code> blocks each take in 2 arguments. These arguments are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> A column label, index, or list of labels; A list of column indexes; A row index </li>
            <li> A Table </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            To see an example of the <code>DELETE</code> blocks in use, we have an example query for each of the 4
            <code>DELETE</code> block variants. Do not run any of these in the Snap<em>!</em> file, but observe
            how they would be called if you needed to call them.
        </p>

        </div>

        <ol>
            <li> The first call deletes the <code>tolls</code> column from the Table </li>
            <li> The second call deletes the 7th column from the Table, which in this case is the <code>tolls</code> column </li>
            <li> The third call simultaneously deletes the <code>pickup_hour</code> and <code>dropoff_hour</code> columns </li>
            <li> The fourth call simultaneously deletes the 15th and 16th columns, which in this case are the
                <code>pickup_hour</code> and <code>dropoff_hour</code> columns </li>
            <li> The fifth call deletes the third row from the Table </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            Be very cautious and precise with the way you delete data from a Table. These actions are very difficult
            to undo, so before you use a <code>DELETE</code> block, make sure you know for sure that you want to delete that data.
