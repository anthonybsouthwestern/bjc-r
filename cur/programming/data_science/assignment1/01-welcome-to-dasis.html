            As Joey Gonzalez, creator of UC Berkeley's Data 100 course puts it: "<b>Data Science</b> 
            is the application of <em>data centric</em>, <em>computational</em>, and <em>inferential</em> thinking to
            <b>understand the world</b> and <b>solve problems</b>". What that essentially means is that
            data science involves learning about the world by asking and answering questions using data.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to best use data science principles, we want to be able to think in a computational way.
            Computational thinking is about formulating things with enough clarity, and in a systematic enough way,
            that one can tell a computer how to do them. This does not necessarily mean thinking exactly like a computer;
            in fact, computational thinking is often a skill heavily aided by creativity and outside-the-box ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
            To engage with data science principles, we will be using a Data Science library
            designed specifically for Snap<em>!</em> known as DASIS (<b>DA</b>ta <b>S</b>cience <b>I</b>n <b>S</b>nap<em>!</em>).
            Using DASIS, we will progressively add more and more tools to our data science "toolkit"
            until you can use all your tools to work on datasets and ask data-driven questions of your own!
