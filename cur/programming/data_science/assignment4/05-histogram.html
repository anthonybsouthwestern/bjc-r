            The second data visualization technique we will cover is a <code>histogram</code>. Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a <b>numerical</b>
            variable. Both <b>discrete</b> and <b>continuous</b> numerical variables can be visualized using a histogram. A histogram involves <b>binning</b>
            the numerical variable and seeing its distribution over all its values. Each row is put into a <b>bin</b> that represents a certain range, and the
            histogram is the result of <b>binning</b> every row and seeing the counts of each bin.
        </p>

        <p>
            The histogram block takes in 6 arguments, 2 that are required and 4 that are optional:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> A Table from which some data will be visualized using a histogram </li>
            <li> A column label whose values will be binned and plotted on the x-axis </li>
            <li> An integer specifying how many bins you want (optional; the default value of -1 lets DASIS decide how many bins there should be) </li>
            <li> A title for the plot (optional; will generate a default title if none is provided) </li>
            <li> An x-axis label for the plot (optional; will generate a default x-axis label if none is provided) </li>
            <li> A y-axis label for the plot (optional; will generate a default y-axis label if none is provided) </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Let's look at some standard uses of the histogram block:
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's say we wanted to see the body mass distribution for all penguins in the dataset. To do so, we would need to group the data by the <code>body_mass_g</code> column
            and then visualize it. The difference is that for horizontal bar plots, the categorical variable already has natural groups, but with a numerical variable,
            you can think of each row's group as the bin it falls into when binning. This grouping/binning happens automatically when you call the histogram block
            (using the <code>GROUP</code> block), but in other languages you will have to do the grouping/binning yourself before visualizing.

        </div>

        <p>
            Using the <code>number of bins</code> argument, we can see the same numerical variable binned into a different number of bins:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/hist-body-mass-4.png" alt="HIST body mass 4 bins" style="width:60%"/>
        </div>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/hist-body-mass-4-stage.png" alt="HIST body mass 4 bins stage" style="width:40%"/>
        </div>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/hist-body-mass-20.png" alt="HIST body mass 20 bins" style="width:60%"/>
        </div>

        <div class="center">

        </div>

        <p>
            Using a proper number of bins is an important part of making a good histogram. The fewer bins you use, the more difficult it can be to see the true distribution,
            but the same is true for using too many bins. With too few bins, a lot of different values fall into the same bins, but with too many bins,
            each row could potentially have its very own bin or make the x-axis difficult to read due to <b>overplotting</b>. This is why it's important to pick an appropriate
            number of bins, or let DASIS decide if you are not sure.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            <b>Overplotting</b> happens when some part of your plot becomes difficult to read. The visualization may be correct, but if people cannot read the plot, it
            defeats the purpose of visualizing the data in the first place.
