            Let's answer some questions about the <code>penguins</code> data using the data visualization techniques we have learned about in this assignment:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> Do any of the species have an uneven split between the sexes? </li>
            <li> Do any of the islands have an uneven split between the sexes? </li>
            <li> Create a histogram of the flipper length column with 15 bins. The distribution here appears to be <b>bimodal</b>, which means that there are two "bumps" in the histogram.
            Typically, distributions with more than one distinct "bump" indicate there are multiple groups of data being visualized at once (for example, on a test where a lot
            of students cheat, the distribution of the class's scores is bimodal because cheaters and non-cheaters are in different data groups). What groups of data are
            causing this bimodal distribution? </li>
            <li> If you were provided data about a new penguin with a flipper length of 220 mm and a bill depth of 15 mm, which species would you guess this penguin is based on
                the data you have about penguins? Do you need any more information to decide? </li>
            <li> If you were provided data about a new penguin with a flipper length of 192 mm and a bill depth of 18 mm, which species would you guess this penguin is based on
                the data you have about penguins? Do you need any more information to decide? </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            These questions could possibly be answered by queries, but the visualizations help us make conclusions faster and more confidently when we can see the
            data represented on a plot.
