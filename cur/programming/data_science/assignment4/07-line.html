            Because line plots require a variable representing time, and the <code>penguins</code> dataset does not contain any time variables, we will be returning to
            the <code>taxis</code> dataset from Assignments 1 and 2. You can re-download it by clicking
            <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/data/taxi_data.csv" download> this link </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The last data visualization technique we will cover is a <code>line plot</code>. Line plots are used to visualize the distribuation of two <b>numerical</b>
            variables. Both <b>discrete</b> and <b>continuous</b> categorical variables can be visualized using a line plot. The numerical variable on the x-axis must be
            a variable that indicates the passing of time, and the second numerical variable can be aby variable leasured over that period of time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The line plot block takes in 4 arguments, 2 that are required and 2 that are optional:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> A Table from which some data will be visualized using a line plot </li>
            <li> A column label whose values represent the passage of time </li>
            <li> A column label to use to group the first column (optional) </li>
            <li> A title for the plot (optional; will generate a default title if none is provided) </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            The first column label must contain time values that are evenly spaced out. Always make sure if you want a line plot that your time variable has a measurement
            for consistent intervals of time. The <code>line plot</code> block will error if this is not the case.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's look at a standard use of the line plot block:
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's say we wanted to see the pattern of pickups for each hour of the day. To do so, we would need to group the data by the <code>pickup_hour</code>
            column and then visualize it. This grouping happens automatically when you call the line plot block (using the <code>GROUP</code> block),
            but in other languages you will have to do the grouping yourself before visualizing.
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/line-pickup-hour.png" alt="HIST body mass" style="width:60%"/>
        </div>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/line-pickup-hour-stage.png" alt="HIST body mass stage" style="width:40%"/>
        </div>

        <p>
            We can use this plot to see patterns about the dataset. In this dataset, the middle of the night and early morning have fewer taxis pickups
            than the daytime, and peak hours occur around 19, which translates to 7:00 PM.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            Think of some explanations for some of the patterns you see. If you can think of some off the top of your head, is it safe to assume these
            are the correct explanations? WHy or why not?
        </p>

        <p>
            Using the optional goruping column argument, we can see a further breakdown of the pickups by time and by the borough of New York the passengers
            were picked up in:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/line-pickup-hour-borough.png" alt="HIST body mass 4 bins" style="width:60%"/>
        </div>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/line-pickup-hour-borough-stage.png" alt="HIST body mass 4 bins stage" style="width:40%"/>
        </div>

        <p>
            As we can see here, Manhattan pickups appear to make up a majority of the taxi rides in this dataset, but we can still see the other pickup
            boroughs at the bottom in other colors.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            Are the patterns from the original single line plot as easy to detect in every borough?
        </p>

        <p>
            DASIS only currently supports 6 different groups (5 colors and the original sprite), so if you are visualizing a column with more than 6 groups
            from the grouping column, you may start to get a repeated use of the original sprite. be careful visualizing too many groups, as you could experience
            <b>overplotting</b>.
