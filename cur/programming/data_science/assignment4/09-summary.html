        <p>
            This brings us to the end of our assignments. By now you have learned some very important ideas in data science and you have also learned some very valuable
            programming skills that help reinforce those ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Always feel free to (safely) download datasets from trusted websites and do some data science of your own using the skills you have learned. You probably know more than you
            think you do, and you have the power to do some very cool things with the knowledge you have!
        </p>

        <p>
            We encourage you to continue your data science education at the university level if you have the opportunity. Classes like
            <a href="http://data8.org/sp22/" target="_blank"> Data 8</a>
            at UC Berkeley, and many other classes like it at countless other universities are a great way to expand your data science knowledge and explore your interest!
