			<div class="prompt">
				<p>
					Which querying blocks could we use (in order from first to last) to <b>best</b> answer the following question about our taxis dataset:
                    What percentage tip did the passenger on the longest ride in the dataset leave?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="choice" identifier="c1">
				<div class="text">
					<code>LIMIT</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, <code>SELECT</code>
				</div>
				<div class="feedback">
					Not quite, if we use the <code>LIMIT</code> block first, we would potentially eliminate the row with the longest ride. This is because we do not know where
                    the longest ride is located in the Table, so we cannot accurately <code>LIMIT</code> the Table to assuredly include that row.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="choice" identifier="c2">
				<div class="text">
					<code>ORDER</code>, <code>LIMIT</code>, <code>SELECT</code>
				</div>
				<div class="feedback">
					Correct! We can first <code>ORDER</code> the Table by distance in descending order, then <code>LIMIT</code> the Table to just the longest ride (the
                    first row of the ordered Table), and finally <code>SELECT</code> the <code>tip</code> and <code>total</code> columns to be able to answer
                    the question with arithmetic.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="choice" identifier="c3">
				<div class="text">
					<code>WHERE</code>, <code>LIMIT</code>, <code>SELECT</code>
				</div>
				<div class="feedback">
					Not quite, although you could use the <code>WHERE</code> block to find the row with the <code>max</code> distance, this would only leave you with one row.
                    Even though this is the row we want to use, the use of the <code>LIMIT</code> block immediately after that is redundant because we do not have any rows we
                    want to eliminate. Always try to make your queries as precise as possible!
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="choice" identifier="c4">
				<div class="text">
					<code>DROP</code>, <code>ORDER</code>, <code>LIMIT</code>
				</div>
				<div class="feedback">
					Not quite, although you could use these three queries in this order to answer the question, we should not use the <code>DROP</code> block in this case
                    because we are interested in 3 of the 18 columns. When we are interested in a small amount of the columns, we should use <code>SELECT</code> instead of <code>DROP</code>
                    to avoid having to write out each of the several columns we want to <code>DROP</code>.
