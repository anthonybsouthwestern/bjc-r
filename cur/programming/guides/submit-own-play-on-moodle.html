   <p>
    Now you get to combine messaging passing and sounds! 
     Create your own play, using two or more sprites with costumes of your choice (but not the default) sprite image. 
     Have the sprites have different scripts, passing messages back and forth, to play notes (or use other features in the sound tab) 
     to make something that appeals to you. Explain your choices in comments. 
    </p>
      
      
	<p>
	   Last but not least, submit a link to your project(s) for the assignment on Moodle!
	</p>
	<p>
		Only one submission per pair is expected. Don't forget to 
include the Honor Code and the name of your partner in your submission.
