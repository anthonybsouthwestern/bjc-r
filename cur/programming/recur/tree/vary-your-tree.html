    <p>Tricky Extra Task for Experience:</p>
    <p>Try to make your tree command output a more realistic tree, like the following:</p>    
    <p><img src="../../../../img/recur/real-tree.jpg" alt="beautiful tree"></p>
    <p> Note that the smaller
    trees are drawn part way up the trunk, instead of at the top of the
    trunk, and the pen color is sometimes green and sometimes brown. </p>
    <p>Important: You should make sure that after each call that the sprite is back in the same exact orientation and position as it was on the call before!
