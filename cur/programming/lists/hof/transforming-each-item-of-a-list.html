<p><br>Suppose we have this list of nouns:<br>
<img border="0" title="giraffe, elephant, pizza, etc." alt="giraffe, elephant, pizza, etc." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/nouns.png"/>

</p>Now suppose we'd like to be able to vary our noun phrases by sometimes using one of these nouns in the plural. So we need a way to add the letter &quot;s&quot; to each item of the list. <em> Yes, we are ignoring the complexities of plurals in English. If you would like to make blocks to handle some of the many variations of plurals in English, feel free, but the lab only requires you to add "s", even if that is not the correct spelling in English.</em> <br/>

      <p><br><b>Try this:</b> Modify your <code>noun phrase</code> block so that half the time it uses a plural noun. <em>You don't have to teach the computer about plurals that aren't just adding s, so again given the nature of the English language, some of them will likely be incorrect plurals.</em> Note that, if you use a plural noun, the article has to be &quot;the,&quot; rather than &quot;a.&quot;</p>
      <br><br>
<p><br><b>Try this: <br></b>
In the last activity we made a list of Beatles:<br>
<img border="0" title="list (list (John) (Lennon)) (list (Paul) (McCartney)) etc." alt="list (list (John) (Lennon)) (list (Paul) (McCartney)) etc." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/Beatles.png"/>
</p>
Write a block using the <code>for each</code> C-block to take this list as input and reports a list of just the first names of the Beatles.<br>
