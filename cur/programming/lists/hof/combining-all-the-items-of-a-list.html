<p><br>Let's say you have a list of numbers, such as all the students' grades on a quiz. You want to find the average grade. There are two steps: First, add up all the numbers; then divide that sum by the number of numbers &#45 that is, by the length of the list.<br>
<br><br>
   Caution: <em> The color of a block can matter! </em>  Snap! has both a red <code>length</code> <code>of</code> block that finds the number of items in a list, and a green <code>length of</code> block that finds the number of letters in a text string. Though they have the same name, they work differently!
   
<br>
<br>First, you'll need to write a <code>sum of</code> reporter that takes a list as input and reports the sum of all of the items in the list.
<br>Then, use the <code>sum of</code> block to define an <code>average of</code> block that takes also list as input.

<br> You can use the following input as one case for testing out the <code>average of</code> block:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/avg781.png" alt="average of the list 7,8,1 is 5.333333" title="average of the list 7,8,1 is 5.333333"/>
<!-- <br>Is that the answer you'd expect?<br><br> -->
<br> As you've seen from prior labs, just because a block reports a correct value on one input, it may not be correct for all inputs. Test enough that you are convinced, detailing what you tested and why in your comments.
   
<br>
<br>
<br> Create, test, comment on, and submit reporters for all of the following functions used in data science and/or statistics:
<ul>
  
  <li><code>sum of</code>: the sum of all of the values in the list</li>
  <li><code>average of</code>: the average of the values in the list, using the sum of block</li>
  <li><code>max of</code>: the largest value in the list</li>
  <li><code>min of</code>: the smallest value in the list</li>
   <li>a predicate <code>increasing</code>: reports true if each consecutive value is at least as large as the previous value</li>
  <li><code>median of</code>: the middle value of an odd number of items or the average of the two middle values for an even number of items. For now, check that the list is increasing first, and if it is not, simply report that rather than calculating the median.</li>
  <li><code>mode of</code>: the most common value in the list. For now, check that the list is increasing first, and if it is not, simply report that rather than calculating the mode.</li>
</ul>
