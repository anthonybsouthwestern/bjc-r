<p><br>Now you will try out many of the other red blocks and see what they do with lists. Recall that shapes of blocks often give you information about functionality.</p>
<p>
  </p>
  </p><br><br>
  <b>Try each of these blocks with values that are appropriate, explaining in the comments what happens:<br><br>
  </b>1. Creating your own list of five or more separate words.</p>
<p> 2. Creating a list of the numbers from 1 to 100, where you only have to type in 1 and 100.</p>
<p> 3. Putting the word <em>mylist</em> in front of the list you created in (1), using a built-in block to do so. </p>
<p> 4. Figuring out what the item of block provides for various numerical inputs. </p>
<p> 5. Trying out the all but first of block, explaining what it does. </p>
<p> 6. Finding the length of your list of numbers in (2), as well as the length of <em>all but the first</em> of the list in (2).</p>
<p> 7. Trying out index of thing in list, and list contains thing, and describing how they are similar and different. </p>
<p> 8. Explaining why is list empty has the type that it does. How could you write a block that has this behavior with other blocks we have seen? </p>


<p>What happens if you drag a <code>list</code> block into an input slot that expects a number as input, such as the inputs to the arithmetic operators?<br><br>
