<p><br>Now you will try out many of the other red blocks and see what they do with lists. Recall that shapes of blocks often give you information about functionality.</p>

      <br><br><div style="margin-left:40px;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/redblocks.png" alt="Some blocks used with lists" title="Some blocks used with lists" ></div>

      
  </p><br><br>
  <b>Try each of these blocks with values that are appropriate, explaining in the comments what happens:<br><br>
  </b>1. Creating your own list of five or more separate words.</p>
<p> 2. Creating a list of the <code>numbers from</code> 1 to 100, where you only have to type in 1 and 100.</p>
<p> 3. Putting the word mylist <code>in front of</code> the list you created in (1), using a built-in block to do so. </p>
<p> 4. Figuring out what the <code>item ... of</code> block provides for various numerical inputs. </p>
<p> 5. Trying out the <code>all but first of</code> block, explaining what it does. </p>
<p> 6. Finding the <code>length of</code> your list of numbers in (2), as well as the <code>length of</code> the <code>all but the first</code> of the list in (2).</p>
<p> 7. Trying out <code>index of thing in</code> list, and list <code>contains thing</code>, and describing how they are similar and different. </p>
<p> 8. Explaining why <code>is list empty</code> has the type that it does. Then write a block that has this behavior with other blocks we have seen, without using the <code>is list empty</code> block. </p>
