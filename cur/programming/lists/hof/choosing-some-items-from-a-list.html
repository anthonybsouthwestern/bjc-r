<p><br>You've might have played Geography, the game in which one player says 
a place name and the next player has to name another place whose first 
letter is the last letter of the previous place: Newark, Kentucky, 
Yonkers, San Francisco, Oklahoma. Have you ever gotten stuck on the 
letter "A"? Oklahoma, Alabama, Asia, Alaska, America, Alameda... and so 
on, forever.</p>
How many states start and end with the same letter? To find out, we first need a list of all the states:<br>
<img title="Alabama, Alaska, ... Wisconsin, Wyoming" alt="Alabama, Alaska, ... Wisconsin, Wyoming" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/states.png" border="0"/>

<p>If you're playing Geography, the question you also really want answered is 
"Which states start with such-and-such a letter?" Define a block
 that takes a letter as input and gives the answer to that question.<br>
<!-- <img title="report (keep...) ..." alt="report (keep...) ..." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/state-starting.png" border="0"></p> -->
<img title="states with P -&gt; pennsylvania" alt="states with P -&gt; pennsylvania" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/p-states.png" border="0"><p>
<img title="states with S -&gt; south carolina, south dakota" alt="states with S -&gt; south carolina, south dakota" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/s-states.png" border="0"/>

<p><br><br><b>Try this: </b>
<p>Write a block that will select (report) all the words of at least 
  five letters from a list. For example, if the words in the list are <code>being</code>, 
  <code>for</code>, <code>the</code>, <code>benefit</code>, <code>of</code>, <code>mister</code>, and <code>kite</code>, 
  then your block should choose the words <code>being</code>, <code>benefit</code>, and <code>mister</code>.
<p>Write a block that takes a list of mixed words and numbers, and selects just the numbers, 
  (Hint: Look for <code>is</code> in the Operators palette.)
<p>Write a block that selects from a list of words the ones that start with a vowel. 
  (Hint: Use <code>contains</code> in the Variables palette.)<br><br>
